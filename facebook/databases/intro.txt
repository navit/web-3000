databases

squel - simple query language


mongodb is comprised of db ; db are compirised of collections;

like unicorn is a collection


db.unicorns.find({gender:"m", weight:{$gt:600}});  
takes a second argument

$ = conditional operators

db.unicorns.find({limiters});

db.unicorns.find({},{name:1,weight:1});  one meand true....give me all the unicorns! the first argument is empty!


db.unicorns.find({gender:"m"},{name:1}).sort({weight:1}).skip(1).limit(2);

insert command to add to write to the db

db.nameofcollection.find(); gives us all

update(); change some info in the field.

update({}); first argument= who do i want to update, what we are changing. use $set to keep all the other parameters and only update one or else it will earase everything we wrote before.

remove();
